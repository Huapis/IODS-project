*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you should use R Markdown syntax.*
This course feels fun. I have done R-course in UEF last year, so I think I have good basic knowledge already. Looking forward of deep diving into this topic. I saw an email from one of our teachers regarding this course, it intrigued me.
